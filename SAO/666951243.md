Intrinsic cell residing in the inner third of the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex. Axons extend laterally, transverse to the folium, and densely innervate the somata of Purkinje neurons. Axon collaterals of the basket cell axon form the specialized terminal plexus, the "pinceau", around the Purkinje cell axon initial segment. Llinas, Walton and Lang.
