Projection neuron in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation and some other brain regions. Pyramidal cells have a pyramid-shaped soma with the apex and an apical dendrite pointed toward the pial surface and other dendrites and an axon emerging from the base. The axons may have local collaterals but also project outside their cortical region (MSH).
