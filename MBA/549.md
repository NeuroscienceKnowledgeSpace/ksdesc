## Description

The thalamus as delineated in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.  Note that compared to the generic definition, the Mouse Brain Atlas considers the reticular nucleus of the thalamus as part of a grouping called, polymodal association cortex related thalamus, rather than as part of the ventral thalamus, as in many classical hierarchies.
