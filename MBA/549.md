## Description

The [thalamus](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0001897) as delineated by the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.  Note that compared to the generic definition, the Mouse Brain Atlas considers the reticular nucleus of the thalamus as part of a grouping called [polymodal association cortex related thalamus](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/MBA:856), rather than as part of the ventral thalamus, as in many classical hierarchies.
