The thalamic reticular nucleus is a shell-like nucleus that forms a capsule around the thalamus laterally and anteriorally. It is separated from the thalamus by the external medullary lamina. Reticular cells are GABAergic, and have discoid dendritic arbors in the plane of the nucleus . It receives projections from the cerebral cortex and from other dorsal thalamic nuclei.  It, in turn, projects to dorsal thalamic nuclei (adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalamic_reticular_nucleus)). The reticular nucleus provides the major source of GABA and inhibitory influence in the dorsal thalamus .  

The reticular nucleus is traditionally considered to be part of the ventral thalamus, although this view is being questioned ([Halassa and Acs√°dy, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27589879)).   The [Allen Mouse Brain Atlas](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/MBA:549) groups it with the polymodal association nuclei-related dorsal thalamus.
