## Description

The more lateral of the two segments of the [globus pallidus](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0001875), abutting the putamen laterally in primates and the medial globus pallidus medially. It is also known as the external segment of the globus pallidus. It is distinguished from the [medial (internal) segment of the globus pallidus](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/index.php/pages/view/UBERON:0002477) by intense staining for enkephalin, due to a heavy projection from enkephalin-containing striatal medium spiny neurons ([DiFiacco et al., 1982](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6275943)). The external segment of the globus pallidus is also distinguished by its efferent projections to the subthalamic nucleus, as opposed to the thalamus and substantia nigra.  It is considered an integral part of the indiect pathway through the basal ganglia, in a model of basal ganglia circuitry first proposed by Albin and colleagues ([1989](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2479133)).
