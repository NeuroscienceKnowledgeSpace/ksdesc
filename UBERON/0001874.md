## Description

Subcortical nucleus of the telencephalon, which together with the caudate nucleus, forms the striatum (or dorsal striatum). In many species, including primates and carnivores, the putamen is separated from the caudate nucleus by the fibers of the [anterior limb of the internal capsule](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0014526) for most of its length, except at its anterior portion.  The putamen lies lateral to the internal capsule and lateral to the [external segment of the globus pallidus](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0002476).  In primates, it is separated from the latter by the external medullary lamina.  The putamen and the globus pallidus (both internal and external segments) collectively are sometimes referred to as the [lentiform nucleus](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/index.php/pages/view/UBERON:0002263), although this is purely a descriptive term, as it is not a nucleus in the classic sense.  The putamen is cytoarchitecturally and hodologically distinct from the globus pallidus, and therefore the lentiform nucleus represents "an arbitrary grouping of adjacent structures" according to Swanson ([Swanson, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12724158)).
