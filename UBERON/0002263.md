## Description

The lentiform nucleus or lenticular nucleus comprises the putamen and the globus pallidus within the basal ganglia in some species, e.g., humans, where this set of structures form a large, cone-shaped mass of gray matter just lateral to the internal capsule. The lenticular nucleus can be considered purely a descriptive term, as it is not a nucleus in the classic sense.  The putamen is cytoarchitecturally and hodologically distinct from the globus pallidus. Swanson ([Swanson, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12724158))refers to the lentiform nucleus as "an arbitrary grouping of adjacent structures".
