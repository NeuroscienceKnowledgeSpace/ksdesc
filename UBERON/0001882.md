A region of the brain located in the forebrain ventral to the [caudate nucleus](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0001873) and [putamen](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0001874) ([caudoputamen](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0005383) in rodent) and continuous with these structures. There is no distinct boundary between the nucleus accumbens and the caudate/putamen, but in rodents, it can be identified by its lack of traversing fiber bundles in comparison to the dorsal striatum. Its principle neuron is the [medium spiny neuron](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/NIFCELL:nifext_141). Together with the neostriatum (caudate nucleus and putamen), the nucleus accumbens forms the [striatum](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0002435). The nucleus accumbens and the [olfactory tubercle](http://kaa.neuinfo.org/wiki/UBERON:0001883) collectively form the ventral striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia. It is considered by many to be the interface between motivation and movement ([Meredith et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18256852))

As first described by Zaborsky and colleagues, the nucleus accumbens can be divided into two compartments, the core and the shell, based on connectivity, morphology and histochemistry.  Behavioral studies also point to functional differences between the core and shell (reviewed in [Meredith et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18256852).
