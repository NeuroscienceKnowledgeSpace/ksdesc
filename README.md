#ksdesc: The repository for KnowledgeSpace entity articles

All articles are written using markdown. For a handy markdown primer please see [this excellent guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Folders are CURIE prefixes, and CURIE fragments are filenames less the file extension.
The each entry corrisponds to an entity identifier in KnowledgeSpace.
