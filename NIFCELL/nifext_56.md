About 50% of all inhibitory interneurons are basket cells. Basket cells specialize in targeting the somata and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons and interneurons, which places them in a unique position to adjust the gain of the integrated synaptic response. The term ‘basket cell’ comes from the basket-like appearance around pyramidal cell somata that results from convergent innervation by many basket cells. On the basis of differences in their axonal and dendritic morphologies, basket cells can be divided into three main subclasses: large basket cells (LBCs), small basket cells (SBCs) and nest basket cells (NBCs). Basket cells typically express many neuropeptides and the two calcium-binding proteins, PARVALBUMIN (PV) and CALBINDIN (CB).
