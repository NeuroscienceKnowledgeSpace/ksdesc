#Definition
Martinotti cells are somatostatin positive interneurons found throughout the neocortex. They are characterized by their short, branching dendrites and multipolar morphology. They occur throughout layers 2-6 of the cerebral cortex, and send their axons to cortical layer I where they form an axonal arborization.
