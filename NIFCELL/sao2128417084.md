Principal neuron of the cerebral cortex (not including hippocampus or olfactory cortex). The pyramidal cell of the neocortex is located in layers 2-3 and 5-6, has a pyramidal-shaped cell body which gives off a number of laterally-directed basal dendrites and usually a single apical dendrite which ascends to branch and terminate in layer 1; these dendrites are covered in dendritic spines.
